# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Rate Prediction Project (India)

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts whether an area is a **high-crime zone** based on crime data from various Indian cities.  
It includes data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning model training.

---

## 🧩 Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and formatted data.
2. **EDA & Visualization** – Analyzed city-wise crime distribution using heatmaps and bar charts.
3. **Model Training** – Used RandomForestClassifier to predict high-crime areas.
4. **Evaluation** – Tested model accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report.
5. **Presentation Slides** – Summarized results and findings.
